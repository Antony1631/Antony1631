✨ Hey there! I'm Deekshith Anthony Raj — Data Whisperer in the Making! ✨
<br>

Ever wondered what secrets data holds? I’m on a mission to find out! As an aspiring Data Scientist, I love diving into raw, messy datasets and emerging with clear, actionable insights — like a digital detective solving business mysteries. 🕵️‍♂️🔍
<br>
💻 My toolkit:
Armed with SQL, Python (NumPy, Pandas), Power BI, Tableau, and Advanced Excel, I build dynamic dashboards, streamline data pipelines, and uncover trends that fuel smarter decisions. Whether it’s reducing supply chain bottlenecks, optimizing financial strategies, or predicting risk — I turn numbers into stories that make an impact. 📊📈
<br>
🎯 Why data?
For me, data isn’t just numbers — it’s a puzzle waiting to be solved, a story waiting to be told, and an adventure waiting to unfold. Each project brings a new challenge, and I thrive on that "aha!" moment when insights click into place.
<br>
🚀 My current quest:
I’m pursuing an MSc in Data Science, AI, and Digital Business at GISMA University of Applied Sciences — expanding my arsenal with machine learning, AI, and advanced analytics.
